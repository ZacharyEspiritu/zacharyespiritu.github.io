# Introduction

Sometimes people ask me what games I have when I invite them over for a board game night. Here is a list of all the games we currently have, with player count and our "expected" runtime based off of our previous plays.

My gaming nights tend to have >4 players, so a number of the games below also take into account the addition of expansions that add additional players. Also, there's often new players to the games, so the "runtime" of each game generally assumes that about half of the players are new to the game.

| Game | Players | Runtime | Teach Time |
|:----:|:-------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| Agricola | 2-6 | 25 min/pp | 30 min |
| A Feast for Odin | 2-4 | 40 min/pp | 30 min |
| Champions of Midgard (w/ Dark Mountains Expansion) | 2-5 | 20 min/pp | 20 min |
| Coup | 4-6 | 30 min | 10 min |
| Fast & Furious: Highway Heist | 2-4 | 20 min/pp | 15 min |
| Kanban EV | 2-4 | 45 min/pp | 45 min |
| Lisboa | 2-4 | 40 min/pp | 45 min |
| Lords of Waterdeep (w/ Scoundrels Expansion) | 2-6 | 25 min/pp | 20 min |
| Rococo | 2-5 | 25 min/pp | 30 min |
