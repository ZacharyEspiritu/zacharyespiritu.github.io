  This is a hacky trick to allow us to include multiple Markdown
  Jekyll content files in the same page. We need to capture the content of the
  file (which is loaded as pure Markdown), then pass it to `markdownify` to get
  it to render as HTML.
{% endcomment %}
{% capture markdown %}
  {% include markdowns/{{ include.markdown_file }} %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ markdown | markdownify }}
