My name is Zach. My pronouns are he/him/his. I'm a senior research engineer at [MongoDB Research](https://www.mongodb.com/company/research).

My research vision is to make privacy-preserving systems for data processing and retrieval so efficient, expressive, understandable, and appropriately secure that they become the default choice in many real-world scenarios. My [recent work](#publications) focuses on structural-invariant-based leakage attacks, automated leakage analysis engines, expressive and efficient encrypted data structures, and application-centric cryptographic design to support at-risk communities. To do this, I maintain a broad set of interests in cryptography, formal methods, data structures, computer systems, and human factors.

I completed a [concurrent Sc.B. and Sc.M.](notes/brown-courses/) at [Brown University](https://brown.edu). My studies were generously supported by grants from [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2021/03/24/ross-briden-and-zachary-espiritu-win-randy-f-pausch-computer-science-undergraduate-summer-research-award/), [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.org/scholarships.html), <a href="https://iamcybersafe.org/s/undergraduate-scholarships">(ISC)<sup>2</sup></a>, and the [CIT Group](https://www.cit.com/). I was also affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Cloud Security Group](http://caps.cs.brown.edu/), where I worked on encrypted database leakage and schemes for specialized queries with [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/).
- [Encrypted Systems Lab](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/), where I designed systems to securely execute public policy studies with [Seny Kamara](http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/).
- [Brown PLT](https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/), where I developed [a Pyret ML library](https://cs0190.github.io/tensorflow.html) with [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/).

I love teaching, and I particularly love teaching computer security. I was the course designer and Head Teaching Assistant of the Computer Science department’s flagship [computer systems security course](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/info/csci1660/) from 2019 to 2021.

Outside of research, I think about things like [long distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/91146604), pottery on the wheel, [theatrical lighting design](design/lighting-design/), Broadway theater producing and investing, small-scale immersive theater, tabletop gaming, and Dance Dance Revolution.
