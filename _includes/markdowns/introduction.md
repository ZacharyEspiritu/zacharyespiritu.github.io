My name is Zach. My pronouns are he/him/his. I'm a senior research engineer at [MongoDB Research](https://www.mongodb.com/company/research).

My research vision is to make privacy-preserving systems for data processing and retrieval so efficient, expressive, understandable, and appropriately secure that they become the default choice in many real-world scenarios. To do this, I combine a broad set of interests in cryptography, systems, formal methods and optimization, and theoretical data structures. I also like to study cryptanalysis attacks that are motivated by practical, real-world systems but grounded in invariant-based, structural formalisms. As a corollary to these goals, I also like to ask questions about the _practicality_ and _usability_ of not just cryptographic primitives, but also cryptography research itself—specifically, how we can build theories and tools to enable researchers to perform research more effectively.

I completed a [concurrent Sc.B. and Sc.M.](notes/brown-courses/) at [Brown University](https://brown.edu). My studies were generously supported by grants from [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2021/03/24/ross-briden-and-zachary-espiritu-win-randy-f-pausch-computer-science-undergraduate-summer-research-award/), [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.org/scholarships.html), <a href="https://iamcybersafe.org/s/undergraduate-scholarships">(ISC)<sup>2</sup></a>, and the [CIT Group](https://www.cit.com/). I was also affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Cloud Security Group](http://caps.cs.brown.edu/), where I worked on encrypted database leakage and schemes for specialized queries with [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/).
- [Encrypted Systems Lab](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/), where I designed systems to securely execute public policy studies with [Seny Kamara](http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/).
- [Brown PLT](https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/), where I developed [a Pyret ML library](https://cs0190.github.io/tensorflow.html) with [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/).

I am passionate about teaching computer security. While at Brown, I spent a lot of time thinking about creatively designing effective mechanisms for developing security mindsets. I was the course designer and Head Teaching Assistant of the Computer Science department’s flagship [computer systems security course](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/info/csci1660/) from 2019 to 2021.

Previously, I was a security engineer at [D. E. Shaw. & Co.](https://deshaw.com).

Outside of research, I think about things like [long distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/91146604), pottery on the wheel, [theatrical lighting design](design/lighting-design/), Broadway theater producing and investing, small-scale immersive theater, tabletop gaming, standup paddleboarding, public transit, and Dance Dance Revolution.
