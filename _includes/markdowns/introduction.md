My name is Zach, though a bunch of people call me Zesp. (You can call me whatever you prefer!) I'm an incoming systems security engineer at [D.E. Shaw. & Co.](https://deshaw.com) in New York, where I'm building systems to enhance the security posture of the firm.

My current technical and research interests focus on applied cryptography, systems security, usable security, and computer systems. I am particularly interested in secure systems designâ€”specifically, how to design cryptographic (and, more generally, secure) systems in ways that are _usable_ and _efficient_, solve real-world problems, and work under real-world constraints and assumptions.

Previously, I worked at Google as a joint intern on the [Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management) and [Google Cloud Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/hsm) teams, where I helped build [open-source tools for securing web servers](https://github.com/googleinterns/cloud-kms-oss-tools) with hardware-protected keys, and at [Negotiatus](https://www.negotiatus.com/), where I architected several customer-facing features that, 5 years later, are still core product features today.

I completed a four-year combined Sc.B. and Sc.M. in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://brown.edu), where I focused on security, systems, and theoretical computer science. My studies were generously supported by scholarships and grants from the [CIT Group](https://learnmore.scholarsapply.org/cit/#:~:text=CIT%20Group%20has%20established%20a,or%20institution%20of%20advanced%20education.), the [CrowdStrike Foundation](https://www.crowdstrike.org/scholarships.html), the [Center for Cyber Safety and Education](https://iamcybersafe.org/s/undergraduate-scholarships), and the [Randy F. Pausch Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2021/03/24/ross-briden-and-zachary-espiritu-win-randy-f-pausch-computer-science-undergraduate-summer-research-award/). I am extremely grateful for this financial support, though these companies and organizations do not necessarily represent my views. I am affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Cloud Security Group](http://caps.cs.brown.edu/), where I researched defenses and attacks on encrypted database schemes with [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/)
- [Encrypted Systems Lab](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/), where I researched applications of searchable encryption and multi-party-computation to support public health initiatives with [Seny Kamara](http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/)
- [Brown PLT](https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/), where I developed [a machine learning library](https://cs0190.github.io/tensorflow.html) for Pyret, a functional programming language used in education, with [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/)

Additionally, I was the course designer and Head Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science department's flagship [computer systems security course](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/info/csci1660/) from 2019 to 2021, where I designed 80% of the assignments, delivered 40% of the course lecture content, and taught over 250 students over three years.

I also really like theater, board games, [lighting design](design/lighting-design/), speech and debate, and rhythm games.
