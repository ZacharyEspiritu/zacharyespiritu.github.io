I'm a 8th-semester concurrent undergraduate and masters student at Brown University **actively seeking full-time software engineering or security analyst / engineering positions with a start date of January / Feburary 2021.**

My current technical and research interests focus on applied cryptography, systems security, usable security, programming languages, and computer systems. I am particularly interested in _practical deployments_ of applied cryptography&mdash;in other words, how to architect cryptographic (and, more generally, secure) systems in ways that are _usable_ and _efficient_, solve real-world problems, and work under real-world constraints and assumptions.

Previously, I interned at Google on [Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management) and [Google Cloud Hardware Security Module (HSM)](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/hsm) teams, where I helped build [tools for securing web servers with HSM keys](https://github.com/googleinterns/cloud-kms-oss-tools), and at [Negotiatus](https://www.negotiatus.com/), where I architected customer-facing features that, 5 years later, are still core product features today.

My studies at Brown University have been generously supported by scholarships and grants from the [CIT Group](https://learnmore.scholarsapply.org/cit/#:~:text=CIT%20Group%20has%20established%20a,or%20institution%20of%20advanced%20education.), the [CrowdStrike Foundation](https://www.crowdstrike.org/scholarships.html), the [Center for Cyber Safety and Education](https://iamcybersafe.org/s/undergraduate-scholarships), and the [Randy Pausch Computer Science Award](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2021/03/24/ross-briden-and-zachary-espiritu-win-randy-f-pausch-computer-science-undergraduate-summer-research-award/). I am extremely grateful for this financial support, though these companies and organizations have not affected my research or necessarily represent my views. Throughout my undergraduate career, I've been affiliated with the following research groups at Brown University:

- [Cryptography, Anonymity, Privacy, and Security (CAPS) Group](http://caps.cs.brown.edu/), where I'm actively researching defenses and attacks on practical encrypted database schemes with [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/)
- [Encrypted Systems Lab](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/), where I'm actively researching applications of searchable encryption and multi-party-computation to support public health initiatives with [Seny Kamara](http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/)
- [Brown PLT](https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/), where I previously augmented Pyret, a functional programming language used in education, with new features such as [a machine learning library](https://cs0190.github.io/tensorflow.html) with [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/)

Outside of Computer Science, I really like musical theater, [lighting design](design/lighting-design/), speech and debate, and rhythm games.
