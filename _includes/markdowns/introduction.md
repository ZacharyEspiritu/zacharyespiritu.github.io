My name is Zach. I'm a Senior Research Engineer at [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) in MongoDB Research's [Cryptography Research Group](https://www.mongodb.com/company/research/cryptography-research-group). My pronouns are he/him/his.

My research broadly combines cryptography, data structures, formal methods and optimization, and algorithms to produce privacy-preserving, efficient systems for multi-party computation, data processing, and retrieval. I also ask questions about the practicality and usability of not just encrypted systems, but also the (theoretical and practical) tools that we use to design, implement, and evaluate them.

Previously, I worked on security engineering at [D. E. Shaw. & Co.](https://deshaw.com) and software engineering at [Google](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management) and [Order](https://www.order.co/).

I completed a concurrent four-year Sc.B. and Sc.M. in Computer Science at Brown University where my studies were generously supported by grants from [Brown CS](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2021/03/24/ross-briden-and-zachary-espiritu-win-randy-f-pausch-computer-science-undergraduate-summer-research-award/), [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.org/scholarships.html), <a href="https://iamcybersafe.org/s/undergraduate-scholarships">(ISC)<sup>2</sup></a>, and others. During my time at Brown, I was the course designer and Head Teaching Assistant of the Computer Science department’s flagship [computer systems security course](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/info/csci1660/) from 2019 to 2021. I was also affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Cloud Security Group](http://caps.cs.brown.edu/), where I worked on encrypted database leakage and schemes for specialized queries with [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/).
- [Encrypted Systems Lab](http://esl.cs.brown.edu/), where I designed systems to support secure public policy studies via encryption with [Seny Kamara](http://cs.brown.edu/~seny/).
- [Brown PLT](https://cs.brown.edu/research/plt/), where I developed [a Pyret ML library](https://cs0190.github.io/tensorflow.html) with [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/).

I’m also interested in [running and ultramarathons](https://www.strava.com/athletes/91146604), speech and debate, public transit, board games, [theatrical lighting design](design/lighting-design/), and Dance Dance Revolution.
