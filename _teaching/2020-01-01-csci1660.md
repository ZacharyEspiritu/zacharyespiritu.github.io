An introduction to principles of computer security from an applied viewpoint and provides hands-on experience on security threats and countermeasures. Topics include cryptosystems, web security, network security, malware, code execution vulnerabilities, access control, cryptocurrencies, machine learning, and human and social issues. With [Roberto Tamassia](https://www.tamassia.net/) (2019, 2020) and [Bernardo Palazzi](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/bpalazzi/) (2021).

* _2021 contributions_:
  - Interviewed, hired, trained, and coordinated staff of 10 undergraduate and graduate TAs.
  - Recurrent guest lecturer in 9 lectures during the semester; delivered over 4 hours of lecture content during the semester.
  - Co-developed and hosted 8 "sections" covering supplementary course content during the semester; developed "discussion" handouts for the sections to help foster community and student-to-student interaction in a remote learning environment.
  - Developed new course project on cloud storage security and secure systems design. Co-designed and developed an implementation-agnostic, adversarial autograder for evaluating and discovering attacks against student implementations, reducing grading workload from 100+ hours of combined TA work hours to ~10 hours of combined TA work hours.
  - Coordinated homework and exam design with staff and professor. Wrote ~50% of the exam problems for 2021.
* _2020 contributions_:
  - Interviewed, hired, trained, and coordinated staff of 11 undergraduate and graduate TAs.
  - Organized creation of new homeworks with a more open-ended, design-based focus; modernized homework content (with questions on cryptography, MPC, web security, networks, data compression, anonymization networks, etc.) and wrote +30 new questions for the entire semester with additional "reserve questions" for future years.
  - Designed new "midterm" component of course focused on open-ended design and security analysis questions; wrote ~80% of the exam problems for 2020.
  - Redeveloped the web security and operating security technical projects to improve learning outcomes and increase efficiency of internal grading processes; facilitiated technical project logistics.
  - Created [_UTA Manual_](http://cs.brown.edu/~zespirit/cs166-uta-manual.pdf) outlining internal staff processes and responsibilities.
* _2019 contributions_:
  - Interviewed, hired, trained, and coordinated staff of 8 undergraduate and graduate TAs.
  - Ported technical components of projects written in Bash, PHP, Javascript, and Go to Google Cloud Platform's [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/).
  - Automated setup process of sandbox Linux virtual machines for each project using the Compute Engine API, reducing setup times by up to ~92%.
  - Co-gave "Passwords" lecture with [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/) password recovery demonstration ([slide deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SmFbqI6iBj8vBhsmP1QCWjczAPojyqkA/view), [video](https://youtu.be/15sfZNWBO7Y?t=2007) starting @ 33:27).
