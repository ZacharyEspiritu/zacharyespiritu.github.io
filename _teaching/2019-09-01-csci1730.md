Explores the principles of modern programming languages by implementation; studies data and their types, including polymorphism, type inference, and type soundness; examines compiler and run-time system topics: continuation-passing style and garbage collection. With [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/people/sk/).

* _2020 contributions_:
  - Interviewed and hired staff of 6 undergraduate TAs.
  - Heavily rewrote 9 assignment specifications on programming language feature implementations in Plait and Racket (examples include ["Interpreter"](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2020/interpreter.html), ["Type Checker"](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2020/tcheck.html), ["Type Inference"](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2020/tinf.html), ["Generators"](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/2020/generators.html)).
  - Transitioned internal staff infrastructure to Gradescope to automate the majority of grading and feedback distribution; developed autograder framework to emulate a Racket version of [Examplar](https://doi.org/10.1145/3291279.3339416), a research IDE helping students assess their understanding of specifications via example-driven development.
* _2019 contributions_:
  - Interviewed and hired staff of 6 undergraduate TAs.
  - Remotely answered student-submitted questions throughout the semester.
  - Copy-edited several assignment specifications written by other TAs.
