[Github Flavored Markdown][github-flavored-markdown] provides lots of unique tools for formatting easy-to-understand READMEs on Github, but there's not a lot of documentation or exposure on some of these features.

Wanting to have a place to store some of the neat tricks I've found, I created this [Gist on Github][better-readme-gist] to serve as a collection of these features. As opposed to some of the more obvious things that make README's awesome (screenshots, GIFs, properly formatted text, etc.), this is intended to be a collection of some of the "extra" features that you can (and should!) use to make your README's more accessible on Github.

The [Gist][better-readme-gist] is embedded below:
