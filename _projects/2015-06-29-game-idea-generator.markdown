# Overview

[Game Idea Generator][game-idea-generator] was a side project I started while studying at Make School. It's an iOS app that creates random game ideas composed of several predetermined phrases.

This is the future of gaming—at your finger tips.

The generator works by first deciding on a game genre, then a player concept. (The player concept is comprised of a noun and some descriptor.) Finally, it comes up with a purpose for the player, which is comprised of a verb and a noun.

You can download Game Idea Generator from the App Store [here][game-idea-generator].
