# Overview

In Spring 2019, I developed the majority of a operating system kernel known as "Weenix" as part of the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1670/">CSCI1670: Operating Systems</a> course (and its optional half-credit lab <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/content/weenix-doc.pdf">CSCI1690: Operating Systems Laboratory</a>) at Brown University.

Weenix was designed to be developed over the course of the entire semester. I did my best to start things as early as possible, and after writing over 6,000 lines of code, I ended up finishing the project three weeks early. (Phew!)

I implemented the following features as part of Weenix:

* **Procs.** Threads, processes, and synchronization primitives.
* **Drivers.** Device drivers for terminals, disks, and the memory devices `/dev/zero` and `/dev/null`.
* **VFS (Virtual File System).** A common interface between the operating system kernel and the various file systems (such as S5FS and device drivers).
* **S5FS (System V File System).** A file system based on the original Unix file system.
* **VM (Virtual Memory).** User address space management, running user-level code, servicing system calls, and basically everything else needed to combine all of the previous componenets into a fully functioning operating system. This includes virtual memory maps, handling page faults, memory management via anonymous objects and shadow objects, and system calls (in particular, the elusive `fork` syscall).
