      In this work, we develop _ARQ_, a systematic framework for creating
      cryptographic schemes that  handle range aggregate queries (sum, minimum,
      median, and mode) over encrypted datasets. Our schemes do not rely on trusted
      hardware or specialized cryptographic primitives such as order-preserving or
      homomorphic encryption. Instead, _ARQ_ unifies structures from the plaintext
      data management community with existing STE primitives. We prove how such
      combinations yield efficient (and secure) constructions in the encrypted setting.
      As part of this work, we designed and implemented a new, open-source, encrypted
      search library called Arca and implemented the _ARQ_ framework using this
      library in order to evaluate _ARQ_'s practicality. Our experiments on
      real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the schemes derived from
      the _ARQ_ framework in comparison to prior work.
