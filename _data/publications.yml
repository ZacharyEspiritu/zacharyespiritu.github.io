      This work addresses expressive queries over encrypted data by presenting
      the first systematic study of multi-attribute range search on a
      symmetrically encrypted database outsourced to an honest-but-curious
      server. Prior work includes a thorough analysis of single-attribute
      range search schemes (e.g. Demertzis et al. 2016) and a proposed
      high-level approach for multi-attribute schemes (De Capitani di
      Vimercati et al. 2021). We first introduce a flexible framework for
      building secure range search schemes with an arbitrary number of
      attributes (dimensions) by adapting a broad class of geometric
      search data structures to operate on encrypted data. Our framework
      encompasses widely used data structures such as multi-dimensional
      range trees and quadtrees, and has strong security properties that
      we formally prove. We then develop six concrete highly parallelizable
      range search schemes within our framework that offer a sliding scale
      of efficiency and security tradeoffs to suit the needs of the
      application. We evaluate our schemes with a formal complexity and
      security analysis, a prototype implementation, and an experimental
      evaluation on real-world datasets.

      In this work, we develop _ARQ_, a systematic framework for creating
      cryptographic schemes that  handle range aggregate queries (sum, minimum,
      median, and mode) over encrypted datasets. _ARQ_ unifies structures from the plaintext
      data management community with existing STE primitives. We prove how such
      combinations yield efficient (and secure) constructions in the encrypted setting.
      As part of this work, we designed and implemented a new, open-source, encrypted
      search library called Arca and implemented the _ARQ_ framework using this
      library in order to evaluate _ARQ_'s practicality. Our experiments on
      real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the schemes derived from
      the _ARQ_ framework in comparison to prior work.

      We present the first systematic security evaluation of multi-attribute range search
      schemes on symmetrically encrypted data. We present four database reconstruction
      attacks that apply to a broad class of schemes and rely on volume and search pattern
      leakage. For schemes achieving efficiency by decomposing a query into a small number of
      subqueries, we further show how to exploit their structure pattern, i.e., co-occurrences
      of subqueries.
