      We design _Synq_, a system that addresses privacy concerns by
      supporting public policy analytics over encrypted data. We
      specifically use an application-centric approach which drives
      _Synq_'s design around a study conducted on the opioid epidemic
      in Massachusetts. We systematize the design considerations of
      the public policy context and demonstrate how the combination
      of design considerations that _Synq_ addresses is novel through
      a survey of the literature. We then present our protocol which
      combines structured encryption, somewhat homomorphic encryption, 
      and oblivious pseudorandom functions to support
      a complex query language that includes filtering (retrieving
      rows by attribute/value pairs), linking (merging rows from
      different tables that represent the same individual) and aggregate 
      functions (sum, count, average, variance, regression).
      We formally express the security of our protocol and show that
      Synq is efficient in practice while satisfying more demanding
      constraints than prior work.

      We present the first systematic study of multi-attribute range search on a
      symmetrically encrypted database outsourced to an honest-but-curious
      server. Prior work includes a thorough analysis of single-attribute
      range search schemes (e.g. Demertzis et al. 2016) and a proposed
      high-level approach for multi-attribute schemes (De Capitani di
      Vimercati et al. 2021). We first introduce a flexible framework for
      building secure range search schemes with an arbitrary number of
      attributes (dimensions) by adapting a broad class of geometric
      search data structures to operate on encrypted data. Our framework
      encompasses widely used data structures such as multi-dimensional
      range trees and quadtrees, and has strong security properties that
      we formally prove. We then develop six concrete highly parallelizable
      range search schemes within our framework that offer a sliding scale
      of efficiency and security tradeoffs to suit the needs of the
      application. We evaluate our schemes with a formal complexity and
      security analysis, a prototype implementation, and an experimental
      evaluation on real-world datasets.

      We present the first database reconstruction attacks
      against response-hiding private range search schemes on encrypted
      databases of arbitrary dimensions. Falzon et al. (VLDB 2022) present
      a number of range-supporting schemes on arbitrary dimensions
      exhibiting different security and efficiency trade-offs. Additionally,
      they characterize a form of leakage, structure pattern leakage, also
      present in many one-dimensional schemes e.g., Demertzis et al.
      (SIGMOD 2016) and Faber et al. (ESORICS 2015). We present the
      first systematic study of this leakage and attack a broad collection
      of schemes, including schemes that allow the responses to contain
      false-positives (often considered the gold standard in security). We
      characterize the information theoretic limitations of a passive persistent 
      adversary. Our work shows that for range queries, structure
      pattern leakage can be as vulnerable to attacks as access pattern
      leakage. We give a comprehensive evaluation of our attacks with a
      complexity analysis, a prototype implementation, and an experimental 
      assessment on real-world datasets.

      We develop _ARQ_, a systematic framework for creating
      cryptographic schemes that  handle range aggregate queries (sum, minimum,
      median, and mode) over encrypted datasets. _ARQ_ unifies structures from the plaintext
      data management community with existing STE primitives. We prove how such
      combinations yield efficient (and secure) constructions in the encrypted setting.
      As part of this work, we designed and implemented a new, open-source, encrypted
      search library called Arca and implemented the _ARQ_ framework using this
      library in order to evaluate _ARQ_'s practicality. Our experiments on
      real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the schemes derived from
      the _ARQ_ framework in comparison to prior work.
