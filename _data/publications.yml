          A cryptographic primitive for "grounded annotations", motivated by the
          needs of activist communication in authoritarian environments. We create an
          broader protocol using this primitive and implement it in a proof-of-concept
          application.

          Attack against a class of TEE-based encrypted
          databases. It allows a _multi-snapshot external memory adversary_
          (weaker than the traditional, _persistent_ TEE adversaries) to learn
          the plaintext of `INSERT` operations on a SQLite database running
          inside of Gramine. We do this by exploiting B+-tree invariants
          that are observable just from snapshots of
          encrypted index files.

          Algorithmic leakage attacks against encrypted, response-hiding,
